# üê¶ HoneyHawk: PowerShell-Based Windows Honeypot

**HoneyHawk** is a lightweight, script-only honeypot system designed for local Windows environments using only native tools and PowerShell ‚Äî no VMs, no third-party software, and no Python.

This project simulates a "decoy sensitive file" and logs access attempts using built-in Windows audit capabilities. It is designed for environments with limited resources or for learning threat detection without additional infrastructure.

---

## üéØ Purpose

To detect unauthorized local file access using PowerShell and native Windows logging, and to simulate the real-world use of honeypots for insider threat detection and monitoring.

---

## üß∞ Tools Used

- PowerShell (native)
- `auditpol.exe` (Windows auditing)
- Windows Event Viewer (`eventvwr.msc`)
- Windows Scheduled Tasks (optional)
- No Python, VMs, or external tools required

---

## üîê Features

- Creates a decoy sensitive file (`passwords.txt`)
- Enables file system auditing
- Logs all read access to the fake file (Event ID 4663)
- Optional export of log entries to `.txt`
- Cleanup script to reverse all changes

---

## üöÄ How It Works

1. Sets up a file in a special folder
2. Applies audit rules to log access
3. Monitors Security Event Logs
4. Access attempts get logged in Event Viewer

## üß™ Sample Detection Output

First, we will pull up our Terminal we will be using PowerShell. Why? because I have been learning it‚Äôs not the gear it‚Äôs the person in the seat and it is that simple, lol.  We will be using PowerShell that‚Äôs right the basics.

We need to of course set the bait which is the basis of a honey pot be advised my firewall is down and all defenses are lowered however I have IDS and IPS in play and I real-time monitoring while performing any and all projects. The following will show my steps via terminal: 
![Screenshot (232)](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8fd0cadd-5bd3-41cc-84c5-2d32487171df) now we need to get a look at view finder and get to event 4663 to see that it was accessed based on the following images:

The Purpose of this project was to display the primary purpose of a Honey Pot and that it can be done on a basic hardtop and knowledge of a programming language
